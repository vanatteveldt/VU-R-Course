# VU-R-Course

* Daily routine:

We have two sessions per day. Each session has the following routine:

1. Background reading and introductory video (asynchonous)
2. Interactive Q&A (plenary zoom) 
3. Supervised practice session (zoom breakout rooms)

The interactive part is 10:30 - 12:00 for the morning session and 14:30 - 16:00 for the afternoon session. Please make sure that you have read the background reading, watched the introduction, and played a little bit on your own before that time so you have your questions ready for the Q&A.
